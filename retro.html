      Retro futurism is a movement created before the  1960s where artist and designers tried to predict what the future would look  like in the 20th century, characterized by a blend of the old  fashioned retro styles with predicted futuristic technology. Retro Futurism explores the themes of tension between  the past and future, and between the alienating and empowering effects of  technology. Primarily reflected in artistic creations and modified technologies  that realize the imagined artefacts of its parallel reality, retro-futurism has  also manifested in the worlds of fashion, architecture, design, music,  literature, film, and video games.<br>
        <br>
        The amazing but scary thing about this movement and the creators of it was no  the things they got wrong but the things they got right, plasma TVs, mobile  phone, personal computers and more. Retro-futurism  incorporates two overlapping trends which may be summarized as&nbsp;the  future as seen from the past&nbsp;and&nbsp;the  past as seen from the future. Retro-futurism of the first type is  inevitably influenced by the scientific, technological, and social awareness of  the present, and modern retro-futuristic creations are never simply copies of  their pre-1960 inspirations; rather, they are given a new twist by being seen  from a modern perspective. <br>
  <br>
      It is directly  inspired by the imagined future which existed in the minds of writers, artists,  and filmmakers in the pre-1960 period who attempted to predict the future,  either in serious projections of existing technology novels and stories. Such  futuristic visions are refurbished and updated for the present, and offer a  nostalgic, counterfactual image of what the future might have been, but is not. </p>
