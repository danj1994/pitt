      Many young  designers find it hard to believe that they can make a living doing something  they find compelling and interesting, something they love. Finding the right  first job, even if it&rsquo;s a summer job or an internship, it&rsquo;s not just an  important step in launching your career. It is an exploration of the field and  a continuation of the learning process. Even the most skilled designer finds  the search for the first job stressful. The suggestions that follow can reduce  that stress by providing an overview of the process.</p>
      <p>Before you  can begin your job search, you need to understand 1.) Yourself: your  motivations, strengths, and weaknesses; 2.) your work: its nature, style, and  variety; and 3.) the job market: corporations, design offices, and a wide  variety of other businesses that employ graphic designers, Then you can get  ready to present yourself and your work in a portfolio.<br>
        <br>
        To create a  portfolio, select only your best work, the work you are proud of and want to  discuss. Bearing in mind that people remember best what is first or last in a  sequence, bind together sketches and show your ability to think, to sketch and  to brainstorm. Meanwhile think about your strengths and weaknesses (we all have  weaknesses), and prepare yourself to discuss them in an interview. Because your  well-crafted, unique communications can take a beating when they are handled,  safeguard your work.</p>
