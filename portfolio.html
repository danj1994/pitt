      In the final  year of a course, when you are considering your final graduating portfolio and  its contents, you might look at your successful projects from throughout the  course (or even your less successful ones) and consider either adding to them  or re-doing them to create some final portfolio works.<br>
        <br>
This is a  useful exercise because you can individualise your portfolio – that is, make it  distinctive from your classmates – by showing different works to them, even  though the projects will be similar. It can also better demonstrate your skill  sets across the portfolio.<br>
<br>
It can also  be a technique to make a potentially boring or easy assignment more interesting</p>
