      Your graphic  design resume is going to be just as important as your portfolio. If not more  important than your portfolio when it comes to job hunting. This is because  most people will examine your resume before they open your portfolio book,  meaning your resume is going to be your first impression! You have to remember  that the people you will be sending your resume to go through tons of these  every day so yours has to be immaculate and memorable, or they won&rsquo;t even  bother looking at your portfolio.<br>
        <br>
        What to  include in your graphic design resume<br>
        Below is a list of everything I would include in a graphic design resume in  order of importance.<br>
  <br>
        Name and Contact Info<br>
        You want to display your name in a very noticeable location along with all your  contact information. It may be a good idea to put a graphic designer some where  in the resume as well in case someone needs to quickly figure out what type of  resume yours is.<br>
  <br>
        Personal  Statement (also known as your objective or mission statement)<br>
        This is where you would write a brief statement about your goals, desire  position and how you can benefit your potential employer.<br>
  <br>
        Your  Experience<br>
        List your job experience here and make sure to include the job title,  employment dates and a brief description of what did and or accomplished.<br>
  <br>
        Education<br>
        Below is a list of information that should be included in the education section</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Your  Degree and Major (e.g., BFA in Graphic Design)</li>
        <li>Date  of Graduation (Month and Year0</li>
        <li>University  You Attended</li>
        <li>Location  of Your University (City and State)</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Capabilities<br>
        This is an area where you can write things such as: extensive experience  dealing with clients, experience managing multiple projects at once and so on.<br>
  <br>
        Software  Skills<br>
        List your software, coding and other design related skills and organize them  into categories if you have a lot of different technical skills.<br>
  <br>
        Awards<br>
        If you have won any awards, contests, been featured anywhere or have had any  shows, make sure to mention them here.<br>
  <br>
        Organizations<br>
        Employers love to see that you are involved in the design community so if you  belong to any design organizations then list them.<br>
  <br>
        Interests<br>
        This isn&rsquo;t really necessary, but if you are applying for a job and want them to  know you have interests related to the job this would be a good place to  mention them.<br>
  <br>
        References<br>
        You don&rsquo;t need to list references directly on the resume but rather state:  References available upon request. Just make sure you have the references if  they do ask for them.<br>
