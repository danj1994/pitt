  This designer toolkit has taken inspiration from many things, the main piece of inspiration I have taken from is a game a use to play called fallout 3, the Pipboy is the inspired piece taken from that game and turned into my own design that I believe reflects Retro Futurism. Other inspirations I have drawn upon are the ideas of the Retro Futurism, a time throughout the 60s where designers and artists alike created the idea of the future and how it would look and what technology would be like in the 20th century.</p>
  <p>The Jetsons is a cartoon created in the movement of Retro Futurism when the average person drives a flying automobile and lives in a space ship themes home, where the everyday life is now lived in the skies. I love the styles of Retro futurism, when designers took aesthetics of their year and implemented them into flying cars, trains and outer space living.<br>
